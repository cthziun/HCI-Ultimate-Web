          <h3>Needfinding</h3>
          <p>We conducted interviews with players and coaches to uncover pain points in ultimate frisbee teams—specifically the imbalance in playtime between rookies and veterans. Key insights emphasized the importance of mentorship, mindset, and the need for better evaluation tools beyond just statistics.</p>

          <h3>POVs and HMWs</h3>
          <p>Using empathy mapping and insights from interviews, we crafted point-of-view statements and “How Might We” questions to guide our design. We explored ways to support players emotionally, visualize improvement, and encourage discipline through gamified systems and team-building features.</p>

          <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>Our initial interface sketches explored key tasks like progress tracking, player setup, and real-time game management. Usability testing helped us identify pain points, leading to early design decisions around layout, terminology, and user flow.</p>

          <h3>Medium-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>We built an interactive prototype in Figma, focusing on user flows for self-evaluation, team management, and game recording. Based on user testing, we refined visual hierarchies and introduced more intuitive interaction models, like tap-to-rate progress and simplified lineup setup.</p>

            </a>
          <p>In response to heuristic evaluations, we revised interface issues such as unclear icons, lack of system feedback, and layout confusion. This version included clearer visual cues, added legends, and a more organized game-tracking interface to improve usability.</p>

          <p>We tested our high-fi prototype with real users across three tasks. Feedback revealed confusion in flows, UI inconsistencies, and layout issues. We proposed concrete fixes like drag-and-drop interactions and visual cues to guide users through evaluations and team setup.</p>

          <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
          <p>We implemented our Figma design in React Native, creating a functional prototype. Features included progress logging, lineup building, and strategy setup. While some tasks remained incomplete, this version demonstrated real app behavior and interactive flows.</p>

            <button class="cta-button">Version 1</button>
          </a>
          <p>The final version featured refined UI design with minimalist aesthetics, drag-and-drop functionality, and better flow integration. Although some transitions to the new UI were still in progress, this version represented our most polished and user-informed design.</p>
